## REST API with Golang

**This repo has the very simple REST API developed with Golang.**

**simple_api.go** is the file that handles the API requests. 

I have used the http package for this. And there is another ready to go package **Mux**. But i wanted to just use only http package to get some insights about it. 

This API can handle the basic CRUD operations.

It has no backend database to store the information,I have just used a variable (I knew, its not recommended and its not an production code but just for the sake of simplicity)

We can start the API server to Serve and Listen on the given port **(i have used 8090)** of the localhost.

## API Overview

This simple API handles the Employee's information. Employee ID will be unique and it is autogenerated by the code.

Sample Employee details:

```
{
    "name": "Logesh",
    "emp_id": 1,
    "EmpDetails": {
        "email": "logesh@my.org",
        "addr": "some addr",
        "phone_no": 94389489
    }
}
```


At First we have one employee details, we can add,update,delete as we wish.

For updating the emploee we have to pass all the details again.

Even you just want to update the "addr" you have pass the entire information except "emp_id".

```
// you can get the entire details for that employee by the get method

{
    "name": "Logesh",
    "emp_id": 1,
    "EmpDetails": {
        "email": "logesh@my.org",
        "addr": "some addr",
        "phone_no": 94389489
    }
}

// here if you want to update the "addr" then for the PUT endpoint we have pass the below body

{
    "name": "Logesh",
    "EmpDetails": {
        "email": "logesh@my.org",
        "addr": "Updated address",
        "phone_no": 94389489
    }
}

```


Once the Employee is deleted then the ID of the deleted employee is not reused for other new Employees.

Every employees will have their own ID.
